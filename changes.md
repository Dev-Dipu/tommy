Here’s a **clear and simple list of what your client wants changed or improved** based on all the screenshots and notes 👇

---

### 🔧 Hero Section Changes

1. **Two text parts instead of one:**

   * **Header (static)**: “We leverage AI to achieve more with less.”
   * **Subheader (animated)**: rotating words like “Businesses | Creators | Artists | Entrepreneurs”.
   * Don’t animate both at once — animate **one word at a time** in the subheader.

2. **Design/Style:**

   * Add **more purple** (their brand color). The hero currently has too much white.
   * The **purple sphere** from before represented their brand better — maybe reintroduce it or add something similar.
   * Add some **interactive or motion background** to make it feel more modern (less static).

### 🎨 Branding & Design Consistency

3. **Typography & Fonts:**

   * Update fonts to look more **modern and on-brand** (they’ve already shared brand fonts in another document).
4. **Brand Colors:**

   * Use their **official color palette** (especially purple tones) throughout the site for consistency.

### 🧩 Card Section (Businesses & Creators)

5. **Card Backgrounds:**

   * Remove random background patterns.
   * Try **solid color with subtle texture or animation** (they mentioned something like [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) cards for inspiration).
6. **Simplify Card Text:**

   * Keep only “Business” and “Creator” — remove subheaders.
7. **Add Animation Flow:**

   * Add a **header above the cards** that says:
     “Whether you are a…”
     → then animate the cards (Business / Creator)
     → then lead into “This is how we are making a difference.”

### 📦 CTA & Footer

8. **CTA Section:**

   * Remove the box unless it’s animated.
   * Keep only the text, but make sure the **background is animated**.
9. **Footer Section:**

   * The **sphere** in the footer is now pointless if the hero changed — remove it.
   * **Redesign the footer** slightly so it feels more **unique** (not too similar to their reference site).

### 🌐 Overall Feedback

10. The site still feels **too static and not modern enough.**
    Add more **interactive, motion, and visual depth**.
11. Ensure **brand identity (purple, fonts, style)** is strong and consistent across every section.

Would you like me to make you a **checklist-style to-do list** you can follow while editing the site (like a task breakdown for each section)? It’ll help you systematically complete everything.
